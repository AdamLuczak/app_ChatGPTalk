ChatGPTTalk is an iOS application that serves as a demonstration of how to integrate the OpenAI ChatGPT API with speech recognition and text-to-speech modules in iOS. This is an open-source project available for download, modification, and use according to your needs. It is not available on the App Store and is intended as a learning and experimentation resource.

## Features
